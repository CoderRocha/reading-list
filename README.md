# My Reading List

"My Reading List" is a simple reading list web app created to understand more the process of building a React
 Application with "Authentication" and "Realtime Database" with 'Firebase' version 9 and 'react-router-dom' version 6.

The project base was build by "iamshaunjp", and i updated the rest of the files to complete the project with the newer version of both 'react-router-dom' and 'Firebase'

# How to run the app correctly?

After you download and extract all the source code on the zip file to it's own folder, you can run the following commands in order on the project directory terminal to install the necessary dependencies to run the application without any issues:

### `npm install`

After the installation, you need to install the "Firebase" version 9.
Run the following command to install the correct version for this project:

### `npm install firebase@9`

After the installation, to start the React application, you need to run the following command in a terminal:

### `npm run start`

And then, access the application in the following local URL:
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The project is about a simple web app Reading List, that allow users to create an account and register the books that they want to read or have already read. It uses real time data with Firebase version 9, and each user can only access their own collection.

It's very simple and intuitive, allowing users to quickly adapt to using the web app each time they want to add a new book to their reading list.

## App Features

- Sign up / Login system
- A List containing all of the books added by the user
- A specific field that the user can add the book onto the reading list 

## Technologies used in this project

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- React.js (With "react-router-dom@6")
- Firebase v9 (Authentication and Realtime Database)

### Final Considerations

This is just a learning project, it doesn't have many features and it's design and systems are relatively simple, because it was build just to learn about the new 'react-router-dom' version 6 features, and how to update it on a project that was using the old methods of the 'react-router-dom' version 5.
